it was a gradual evolution,a long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs.The only way I made progress-the only choce i had-
was to start small
The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.
"cue,routine reward" "stimulus,responese reward"

“the aggregation of marginal gains,”is the
philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do

“The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down
everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by
1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.”

 “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter
hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a
crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I
know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”

You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your
systems.

If
nothing changes, nothing is going to change.

 “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you
will call it fate.”
