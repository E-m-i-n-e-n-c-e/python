In endgames dont rush and attacking is better than defending
4 rules
1) Move your piece to the most advanced square that's possible under the circumstances.
2) Don't make your bishop a tall pawn.
3) Defend only when needed. Work out the possible threat in your mind first to decide if it's one at all.
4) When in doubt what to play, make your least active piece better.

if one rook comes forward the other can be taken
if no rook is in the back rank the king can be taken
When kings f pawn is pushed you can sacrifice the horsey to take e pawn

How to not blunder
1)do not make instant moves.See one move ahead
2)ask yourself what has changed and ask yourself if the square you are moving your piece to is protected
3)Ask yourself how your opponent can attack you and infiltrate your first 4 ranks
4)do not let your opponent in your first 4 ranks
5)Ask what is the idea behind opponents move
6)look for ways to counter attack
